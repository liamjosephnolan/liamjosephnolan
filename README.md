Hello! I am Liam, a Mechanical/Mechatronics engineer with a passion for Robotics! I have all sorts of personal projects on here ranging from a gesture controlled Arduino, to a a Portfolio Website!
While my background and expertise lies in Mechanical design, I spend a lot of time toying around in Linux with various robotics projects. I'm a self taught coder so some things might be a bit wack. 
Anyways, hope you enjoy poking around here!
